I'm launching hackathon.maximally.in, a neon-themed platform that helps 13–18-year-olds start real businesses through student hackathons and startup bootcamps. It offers:

Hackathon-as-a-Service for schools/youth orgs

Startup bootcamps

Sponsorship and hosting tools

The visual style is retro-futuristic (black background, neon accents, pixel/glitch design). The brand is bold, energetic, inspiring—but still sharp and professional.

I need a complete SEO setup to get this site ranking, including all technical, structural, and content-related best practices. Please provide:

✅ 1. Technical SEO Setup
robots.txt configuration

XML sitemap setup

Canonical tag implementation

URL structure suggestions (clean, SEO-friendly)

Site speed best practices (lazy loading, CDN, compression, etc.)

Mobile responsiveness checks

Core Web Vitals optimization

HTTPS / SSL enforcement

Schema markup (Organization, Events, FAQ, etc.)

🗂️ 2. Site Architecture & Pages
Homepage (value prop, CTAs for joining/hosting)

Hackathon-as-a-Service page

Bootcamps page

Sponsor info page

Case studies/success stories

Blog for content marketing + SEO

City/school-specific landing pages if useful (e.g. /hackathon-in-mumbai)

🔍 3. Keyword Strategy
High-volume keywords for student hackathons, teen entrepreneurship, etc.

Long-tail keywords like “how to host a hackathon for high school”, “startup bootcamp for teenagers”

Keyword mapping to site pages

🏗️ 4. On-Page SEO
Title tags, meta descriptions, and H1-H3 recommendations

Internal linking strategy

Image optimization (alt tags, filenames)

🧱 5. Content Plan
Blog post ideas (educational, inspirational, event recaps)

Evergreen content suggestions (e.g. “Ultimate Guide to Hosting a School Hackathon”)

Content clusters around key search topics

🔗 6. Authority Building
Backlink outreach suggestions (schools, STEM blogs, youth orgs)

Directory or partnership opportunities

Press release strategy (e.g., every major hackathon or sponsorship deal)

Assume this is being built from scratch on a fast, modern stack (Next.js or similar), and we want to launch with solid foundations.
